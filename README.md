# Lead-Score-Case-Study
## Problem Statement:
X Education, an online education company, provides courses to industry professionals. Each day, many professionals visit the website through various marketing channels, such as Google and other platforms. Visitors may browse courses, watch videos, or fill out a form providing their contact details. Once a visitor submits their details, they become a lead. Leads are also acquired through referrals.

The sales team engages with these leads through calls and emails, aiming to convert them into paying customers. However, the current lead conversion rate is only 30%, meaning that out of 100 leads, only around 30 complete a purchase.

To improve efficiency, the company wants to identify high-potential leads ("Hot Leads") who are most likely to convert. By prioritizing these leads, the sales team can focus their efforts more effectively, increasing the conversion rate to the targeted 80%.

The lead conversion process can be visualized as a funnel, where many leads enter at the top, but only a few convert at the bottom. The goal is to nurture potential leads through engagement and communication to improve conversions.
